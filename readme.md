# Repository for RAMDE Project

The goal of this repository is to serve as a template for the project assignment developed during the RAMDE course of the Master Program in Critical Computing Systems Engineering, edition 2024/25.

**Please follow the instructions of the teachers of your course because they will always prevail over what is stated in this readme file.**

## Folders for Each Assignment

**The project is split in multiple assignments.**

Each assignment of the project should be inside a specific folder (i.e., folders **assignment1**,  **assignment2**, etc.).

## Assignment Assessment

All artifacts produced during the project (including documentation) are **required** to be committed to the repository.

A significant evidence of student performance during the project is the commit activity in the repository.

**All deadlines are to be honored.**

**_Project final presentation is mandatory for all students._**

## Issues and Commits

Each team will have a fork of this repository in bitbucket.

It is a good practice to create an **Issue** in bitbucket for each task that your team or you individually will be developing.

Each commit in your repository should always make a reference to the corresponding issue.

You should also close the issue when the task is finished.

For each deadline/submission of your task/project you should also create a tag in the repository.

## Documentation
It is mandatory to produce documentation for all your tasks/assignments. The documentation **must** always be produced in a readme.md file. You should use a readme file inside each assignment folder.

In the readme you should make clear the contribution of each member of the group for each task.

These readme.md files use markdown. You may find further documentation about markdown in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
